# SecureServerAutomation
This is the practical project component of Cristian Rivera's Senior Capstone
Research Project for the Cyber Operations program at the University of Arizona.
This is an automation that will provision a Windows Server 2016 and enforce the
DISA STIGs on the provisioned server immediately after creation.
